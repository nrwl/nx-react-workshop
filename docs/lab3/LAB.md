### 💻 Lab 3 - Executors

###### ⏰ &nbsp;Estimated time: 5-15 minutes

We'll build the app we just created, and look at what executors are and how to customize them.

## 📚 Learning outcomes:

- **Understand what a `target` and `executor` are**
- **Invoking executors**
- **Configure executors by passing them different options**
- **Understand how an executor can invoke another executor**

#### 📲 After this workshop, you should have:

## 🏋️‍♀️ Steps:

1. Build the app

   <summary>🐳 &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

   </details>

2. You should now have a `dist` folder - let's open it up!
   - This is your whole app's output! If we wanted we could push this now to a server and it would all work.
   - Open one of the files, for example `main.js` and look at it's contents
<br/>

3. Open up `workspace.json` and look at the object under `projects/store/targets/build`
   - this is the **target**, and it has an **executor** option, that points to `@nrwl/web:build`
   - Remember how we copied some images into our `/assets` folder earlier? Look through the executor options and try to find how it knows to include them in the final build!
<br/>

4. Send a flag to the executor so that it builds for production

   <details>
   <summary>🐳 &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

   `--configuration=production`

   </details>

5. Open up the `dist` folder again - notice how we now generated a `3rdpartylicenses.txt` file, as per the "production" configuration in `workspace.json`. Also notice how all filenames have hashed suffixes. Open one of the files, for example `main.{hash}.js`. Notice how its content is now different.
<br/>

6. The **serve** target (located a bit lower in `workspace.json`) also contains a executor, that _uses_ the output from the **build** target
<br/>

7. Inspect what changed from the last time you committed, then commit your changes
