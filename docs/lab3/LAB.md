### üíª Lab 3 - Executors

###### ‚è∞ &nbsp;Estimated time: 5-15 minutes

We'll build the app we just created, and look at what executors are and how to customize them.

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Understand what a `target` and `executor` are**
- **Invoke executors**
- **Configure executors by passing them different options**
- **Understand how an executor can invoke another executor**

#### üì≤ After this workshop, you should have:

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps:

1. Build the app

   </details><br />

2. You should now have a `dist` folder - let's open it up!

   - This is your whole app's output! If we wanted to, we could push this to a server, and it would all work.
   - Notice how all files have hashes in their suffix.
   - Open one of the files, for example, `main.{hash}.js`, and look at its contents. Notice how it's minified.
     <br />

3. Open the **Project Details** for your `store` app and expand the `build` section listed under "Targets."

   - This is a **target** that uses the [`nx:run-commands`](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/executors/run-commands#nxruncommands) **executor** to call `webpack-cli` to build the app.
   - Since the build target uses the [`webpack-cli`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/), like you would with any other webpack build, you can configure webpack using the `webpack.config.js` file in your project.

   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>
   The easiest way to open the Project Details is by using the <a href="https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup">Nx Console from within VS Code or a JetBrains IDE</a>. Once installed, you can access <a href="https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-console/console-project-details">the Project Details Views in multiple ways</a> without leaving your editor.
   <br /><br />

   If you prefer to use the CLI, or are using an editor without Nx Console support, you can also open the project details in your browser by running `nx show project <project-name> --web`.

4. Configure license extraction during production builds

   - Explore the `webpack.config.js` file for the `store` app.
   - Remember how we copied some images into our `/assets` folder earlier? Look through the webpack config and try to find how it knows to include them in the final build!
     <br />
   - Configure webpack to `extractLicenses` into a `3rdpartylicenses.txt` file during the build, but only when the node environment is `production`.
   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

   The `NxAppWebpackPlugin` takes an `extractLicenses` option.

    </details><br />

5. Build the app again

   - Notice how we now have a `3rdpartylicenses.txt` file in the `dist` folder.

6. Add a `development` configuration to the `build` target that changes the `node-env` argument to `development`.

   - Nx detects the presence of tooling configuration, in this case `webpack.config.js`, and automatically [infers targets](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) needed to run that tool with a set of common defaults (`build`, `preview`, `serve` in this case).
   - These targets can be modified by adding additional configuration to the `targets` key in the `project.json`.
   - Targets can have multiple configurations that allow for the execution of the same tool with different options.

   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

   - The key you need to add to the `project.json` is `targets.build.configurations.development.args`.
   - Use the Project Details view to see how the environment is being set to production as an example.

   </details><br />

7. Build the app one more time, but this time using the development configuration we just created.
   <details>
   <summary>üê≥ &nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

   `--configuration=development`

   </details><br />

8. Open up the `dist` folder again - notice how the `3rdpartylicenses.txt` file is gone, as per the "development" configuration in `project.json`. Also, notice how filenames no longer have hashed suffixes. Open one of the files, for example `main.{hash}.js`. Notice how its content is now fully readable, and there are sourcemaps attached to each of the compiled files.
