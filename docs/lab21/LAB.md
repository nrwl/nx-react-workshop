# üéà Lab 21 - Setting up CD for automatic deployment

###### ‚è∞ &nbsp;Estimated time: 10-20 minutes

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Understand how to configure a simple Continous Deployment system using Nx and GitHub actions**
- **Learn how to expose custom secrets on GitHub to your CD processes**

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. Add a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file
   <br />

2. Using your `ci.yml` config as an example, see if you can configure automated deployments from the `main` branch:

   Anytime we push or merge something to the `main` branch it:

   - builds the `store` and `api` for production
   - deploys the `store` and `api`

   We'll start you off:

   ```yml
   name: Deploy Website

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main <-- workflow will run everytime we push or merge something to main
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       name: Deploying apps
       steps: .... <-- ADD THE STEPS HERE
   ```

   <br />

3. Our "deploy" targets are using some secret ENV variables though. We'll need to make these available on GitHub:

   1. Go to your GitHub workshop repo
   2. Click on **"Settings"** at the top
   3. Then **"Secrets"** on the left menu bar
   4. Add values for all the variables we've been keeping in `.local.env` files

   ![GitHub secrets](./github_secrets.png)
   <br />

4. Then back in our `deploy.yml` file, let's expose these secrets to the processes (use `ci.yml` as an example of where to put these):

   ```yml
   env:
     SURGE_DOMAIN_STORE: ${{ secrets.SURGE_DOMAIN_STORE }}
     SURGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SURGE_TOKEN }}
     FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
     NX_API_URL: https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev
   ```

   <br />

5. Since we'll be re-deploying, we want to test if we're looking at a new version of our code:

   - Make a change to your API (maybe change the name of one of the games)
   - Make a change to your Store (maybe change the title in the header)
     <br />

6. Commit everything locally on `main` and then push (it's important we push to the `main` branch as that's where our workflow runs)
   <br />

7. You should see your new workflow start up under the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repo
   <br />

8. Once it's done, navigate to your frontend Surge deployment URL and test if you notice the new changes (the ones you made to the Store and also to the API)
   <br />
